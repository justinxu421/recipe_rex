Place the wood ear mushrooms in a small bowl and cover with hot water. Let rehydrate for 15 minutes, or until thoroughly tender. Drain, remove and discard any tough ends, and slice the mushrooms into thin strips.
Slice the chicken against the grain, first into thin slices then into thin strips.
Use your hands to gently coat the sliced chicken with the shaoxing wine, salt, and pepper. Then add the cornstarch and mix again until fully coated. Do the same with the sesame oil. This will help keep the chicken strips from sticking together. Marinate for 10 to 15 minutes.

Add the salt, tea, and peppercorns to a pan. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring regularly, until smoking.
Remove the pan from the heat and add the granulated garlic. Transfer everything into a spice grinder or a small food processor. Grind until everything turns into a granulated spice mix.
Combine the shaoxing wine and sesame oil in a small bowl. Stir well.
Transfer the chicken into a large bowl. Rub the chicken with the sesame oil mixture on the inside and outside until well coated.
Sprinkle the Sichuan peppercorn salt mixture onto the inside and outside of the chicken. Gently pat and rub with your hands until evenly coated.
Stuff the cavity with green onions and ginger. Seal with the garlic, with the cut side facing the inside of the chicken. Secure the stuffing by stitching together the cavity with a toothpick (skip this if you don’t have a toothpick). Tuck the wing tips underneath the breasts to prevent burning.
Place the chicken breast-side-down in the same large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. Let it marinate overnight in the fridge. Rotate once halfway through marinating (it’s OK if you forget the rotating).
Roast the chicken
Adjust the oven rack, so the chicken will be positioned in the middle of the oven. Preheat the oven to 450 °F (232 °C). Line a roasting pan with foil for easy cleaning. Pour in a cup of water to prevent the drippings from burning. Place a roasting rack into the pan.
Option 1 - Fussless roasting
Drizzle the extra marinating liquid onto the chicken. Roast the chicken at 450 °F (232 °C) for 30 minutes.
Take the chicken out of the oven. Turn the oven to 350 °F (176 °C). Drizzle additional sesame oil onto the chicken. Add more water to the pan if needed.
Return the chicken back to the oven. Roast at 350 °F (176 °C) for another 30 minutes, or until the juices run clear.
Option 2 - Extra crispy thigh
If you happen to have an adjustable roasting rack, you can use this method to get extra crispy thighs. Start the roasting by shaping the roasting rack into a “V” shape. Grease the rack with a thin layer of oil to prevent sticking. Place the chicken on its side, so the thigh and the wing are facing up. Drizzle a few teaspoons of the marinating liquid onto the chicken. Roast at 450 °F (232 °C) for 15 to 20 minutes, until the top of the thigh turns golden brown.
Take the chicken out of the oven. Wearing a pair of oven mitts and holding both ends of the chicken, flip it so the other thigh and wing face up. Drizzle the rest of the marinating liquid onto the chicken. Continue to roast at 450 °F (232 °C) for 10 to 15 minutes, until the top of the thigh turns golden brown.
Take the chicken out of the oven. Turn the oven to 350 °F (176 °C). Drizzle additional sesame oil onto the chicken. Add more water to the pan if needed.
Return the chicken to the oven. Roast at 350 °F (176 °C) for another 30 minutes, or until the juices run clear.
Test doneness and rest
For a smaller chicken (under 4 lbs / 1.8 kg), I would test the chicken at the 20-minute mark, just in case, to avoid overcooking. For a bigger chicken, you might need 10 minutes or more of additional roasting time at 350 °F (176 °C) to finish.
For a more accurate reading, use an instant-read thermometer, inserted into the thickest part of the thigh and breast. The thigh should read at least 160 °F (71 °C) and the breast at least 155 °F (68 °C). While resting, the temperature of the dark meat will continue to go up and should reach 165 °F (74 °C), the safe temperature recommended by the FDA. Note, I prefer to cook chicken breast slightly under 165 °F (74 °C), which yields super juicy and tender results.
Let the chicken rest for at least 10 minutes before serving. It will stay pretty hot for about 30 minutes.
(Optional) Bonus - chicken rice
Collect the pan drippings in a measuring cup. Add water to the drippings to reach the needed amount of liquid, depending on the type of rice you’ll make. You will need 1 3/4 cup of liquid for jasmine rice, or 1 1/4 cup of rice for medium or long grain rice. Check out my rice cooking guide for more information.
Add the rice into a small saucepan. Add water to cover. Rinse in a circular motion with your fingers a few times. Drain the water and repeat the process one more time. Drain the water thoroughly.
Add the pan dripping water mixture, ginger, and a pinch of salt.
Cook over medium heat until the water comes to a full boil. Cover the pan and turn to low heat immediately. Steam 15 minutes for jasmine and long grain rice, and 18 minutes for medium grain rice. Do not uncover the pot during steaming.
Once the rice is done cooking, remove the pan from the stove. Let sit, covered, for another 10 minutes.
After resting the rice, use a fork or spatula to fluff it. Taste the rice. Add more salt and mix again, if needed.

Combine the sauce ingredients in a saucepan. Heat over medium heat until bringing to a boil. Boil for 5 to 10 minutes until slightly thickened. Set aside to cool.
Bake the ham
Preheat oven to 325 °F (162 °C). Set up a roasting pan with a wire rack. Pour 1 cup of pineapple juice into the bottom of the pan.
(OPTIONAL) If the ham has a thick layer of skin, remove it by running a knife across the leg, cutting through the skin without cutting the meat, and peeling off the skin with your hand. Then you can slice your ham in diagonal lines 1” (2.5 cm) apart, 1/2” (1 cm) deep, to create the crosshatch pattern.
Place your prepped ham on the rack. Brush it with the glaze. Bake it for 10 minutes per pound (0.45 kg) if the ham is fully cooked. It will take about 1 to 1.5 hours to cook the ham through. Or bake 25 minutes per pound (0.45 kg) for a partially cooked ham. It will take about 2-3 hrs to cook the ham through in this case.
Baste the ham every 20 minutes. If you’ve used up all the sauce, you can baste it with the juice from the pan. If the juice in the pan starts to get too thick, add some water to it to prevent burning.
Once the ham is baked (the internal temperature has reached 135 °F / 57 °C) and the glaze is caramelized, remove the pan from the oven.
On the bottom of the pan, the drippings should have formed a thick glaze. Spoon those drippings over top of the cooked ham until fully covered. Allow to rest for at least 10 minutes before carving and serving.
Store & Reheat
You can make the ham up to 4 days in advance and reheat it the day you serve it. If you plan to make the ham ahead of time, you should skip the final glaze and save the pan drippings in an airtight container.
To reheat the ham, cover it loosely with foil and reheat it in a 325 °F (162 °C) oven until it’s warm throughout, 5 minutes per pound (0.45 kg). It takes about 30 minutes to warm up a 6-lb (2.7 kg) ham and 50 minutes for a 10-lb (4.5 kg) ham. Note, you don’t want to heat up the ham too much, as it will cause the meat to dry out.
Heat up the glaze in a microwave. Brush the glaze over the ham once it’s warmed up.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 serving', 'calories': '383 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '47.4 g', 'proteinContent': '24.1 g', 'fatContent': '12.5 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '5 g', 'cholesterolContent': '75 mg', 'sodiumContent': '1811 mg', 'fiberContent': '2 g', 'sugarContent': '25.4 g'}",5.0,,Omnivore's Cookbook,105,8 serving(s)

Sprinkle 3 tablespoons of the mix over the chicken legs and rub it in so that the legs are evenly coated.
(Optional) Use your finger to separate the chicken skin from the thigh meat, making sure the edges stay attached. Rub some dry spices under the skin. This step helps the skin to crisp up even more and makes the meat more flavorful.
Let the rubbed legs rest, uncovered, in the refrigerator for 30 minutes to an hour, or 15 to 20 minutes at room temperature.
Combine the dry coating ingredients and the 1 remaining tablespoon of the spice mix in a big shallow plate. Stir to mix well. Add the buttermilk to another low, shallow dish.
Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking tray with foil for easy clean-up and place a baking rack on the tray. Generously spray the rack with cooking oil.
Once the legs are done marinating, prepare your coating station with the plate of chicken legs, the dish of buttermilk next to that, then the dry coat mixing (I also recommend having a spoon to scoop the dry mix over the chicken).
One at a time, hold the tip of the drumstick using one hand, dip the leg into the buttermilk, and flip to coat the other side. Let the excess buttermilk drip off, then place the leg into the dry mix. Scoop the dry mix over the leg and gently press it in, turning and repeating until the leg is coated. Gently shake off any excess coating and lay the leg on the rack, skin side up.
Add the legs to the oven and bake for about 45 minutes in total, until the chicken is crispy and lightly browned. After 10 minutes take the legs out and drizzle them with a small amount of oil and bake for another 20 minutes. Gently flip the chicken to crisp the bottom, for 10 minutes or so. For the last 5 minutes, flip the chicken right-side-up again to finish up. Once done, test the chicken by inserting a thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh and it should read at least 165°F (74°C). Or you can insert a sharp paring knife into the thigh and the juice should run clear. Bake for another few minutes if the chicken is not yet fully cooked.
Once baked, let the chicken cool off for 5 minutes. Serve over steamed rice as a main dish.

Combine the minced ginger and hot water in a small bowl. Stir to mix well and set aside.
Prepare the dough
In a large tall plate or a big bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, cornstarch, instant yeast and sugar. Stir to mix well.
Slowly pour in the warm water, a few tablespoons at a time, and mix with a pair of chopsticks (or a fork). Once all the water has been added, keep mixing and scrape off the dry flour on the side of the bowl, until it forms many small dough flakes.
Pour in the vegetable oil. Keep mixing with the chopsticks until the oil is absorbed.
Start kneading by hand while further incorporating the dry flour, until there’s no dry flour left in the bowl.
Transfer the dough onto a working surface. Knead for 15 to 20 minutes, until the dough is quite smooth and elastic and there’s no dry flour left in the bowl. It’s OK if there’s some unevenness in the dough, which will smooth out after resting. The dough should be quite tough and not sticky to the touch. Cover and seal the bowl with plastic wrap. Let rest until it doubles in size, 1 hour or so.
Prepare the filling
Add the ginger water, light and dark soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, salt, sugar, and white pepper to the ground pork in a large bowl. Beat with a pair of chopsticks or a wooden spatula in a circular motion, until all the liquid is absorbed and the meat is sticky. This process might take a few minutes. (*Footnote 4)
Add the green onions and sesame oil. Mix until they are incorporated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Store in the fridge until ready to use.
Assemble the buns
When the dough has rested, transfer to a work surface and punch it down. Knead for 1 minute to deflate the air out completely, then form it back into a ball.
Cut the dough in half. Wrap half of the dough in plastic wrap and store in the fridge while working on the other half.
Poke a hole in the center of the dough you’re working with. Stretch the dough into a large oval by running your fingers along the inside of the hole in a circular motion. Once the diameter of the dough is about 1” (2.5 cm), tear apart the ring so it creates a long, thin strip.
Cut the dough strip into 12 even pieces by cutting it in half, then further cut each half into 6 pieces. Gently use a circular motion to round up each dough piece then flatten it with your palm. Cover them with plastic wrap to prevent drying out.
Work on one piece of dough at a time - take one dough piece and place in front of you. Roll it with a rolling pin in one hand, using the other hand to rotate the dough while rolling, until the diameter reaches 5” (13 cm). You should keep the edges thinner than the center, so the wrapper of the bun will be even once you make the pleats.
Place the rolled dough in your palm and add 1 tablespoon of filling in the center.
Start wrapping the bun by folding and pinching the edge over itself, in one direction, until it is almost sealed. Then rotate and pinch the top of the pleats to fully seal the bun. (View my video for more details)
Repeat with the remaining dough pieces to wrap all the buns. Keep the wrapped buns under a piece of plastic wrap to prevent drying out. Once done wrapping, let rest for 10 minutes. Once rested, you should cook the buns immediately. You can store the wrapped buns in a sealed container in the fridge for up to 1 hour before cooking.
Repeat the wrapping steps to wrap the other half of the dough.
To cook the buns:
Add 2 tablespoons of oil and carefully place 12 wrapped buns into a 9” or 10” skillet. Heat over medium-high heat until hot. Turn to medium heat. Cook, uncovered, for 3 minutes, until the bottoms are lightly browned.
Pour about 1/4 cup hot water into the pan, just enough to cover the buns halfway up. Cover the pan and cook over medium heat for about 8 minutes, until the water is completely evaporated.
Turn the heat to medium-low and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the heat off and remove the pan from the stove. Let the buns rest with the lid on for an additional 2 minutes. Remove the lid and transfer to a plate. Repeat the steps to cook the rest of the buns.
Serve hot immediately.

Lanzhou Beef Noodles (兰州拉面),Maggie Zhu,https://omnivorescookbook.com/recipes/lanzhou-beef-noodles/,Chinese,https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Lanzhou-Beef-Noodles-550.jpg,"['1 beef leg bone (about 700 grams / 25 ounces, cut into 5 to 6 parts (*see footnote 1))', '1 kilogram (2 pounds) beef flank (, untrimmed (*see footnote 2))', '5 whole cloves', '1 teaspoon Sichuan peppercorn', '5 cloves garlic', '1 thumb ginger (, sliced)', '1 cup scallion (, chopped (the white part))', '5 chili pepper (, dried)', '2 bay leaves', '1 whole nutmeg seed', '1 star anise', '1 cinnamon stick ((about 6 centimeters / 2.4 inches long))', '1 teaspoon fennel seed', '2 teaspoons salt ((or to taste))', '1 small daikon radish', '2 tablespoons freshly made Chinese chili oil', '6-8 servings hand-pulled noodles ((or dried noodles))']","To cook the broth
Thoroughly rinse leg bones and transfer them to a 5-liter (5-quart) dutch oven (or big pot).
Cut the beef flank into strips that are around 8 centimeters (3 inches) wide and 12 centimeters (5 inches) long. Place them into the dutch oven.
Add 10 cups of water to cover the bones and beef. Bring to a boil over high heat. Turn to medium low heat and continue to boil for 10 minutes. Use a ladle to skim the foam from the surface and discard it, repeating until the broth comes clean.
Add cloves and Sichuan peppercorn into a tea infuser, and place the infuser in the dutch oven with the beef and bones. Add ginger, scallion, garlic, chili pepper, bay leaves, nutmeg, star anise, cinnamon stick and fennel seed to the pot, as well. Cover and simmer over low heat for 3 hours. Depending on the cut of beef you’re using, you may need to simmer longer, up to 4 hours.
While the broth is simmering, prepare the daikon radish. Peel the radish and cut it into 5-millimeter thick slices. Further divide each slice into 4 quarters. 30 minutes before the broth is done, add the daikon radish slices to it.
Check the broth every 30 minutes. During the first 2 hours, if the water is evaporating too quickly, add 1 to 2 cups boiling water to keep the beef and bones covered. You should not add any water during the final hour of simmering. The beef and radish should become very tender and the broth should turn a pale brownish yellow color. Add salt to season the broth. The broth should taste slightly salty by itself.
Use a ladle to transfer the beef to a plate to cool off. Use a strainer ladle to pick out the bones and spices and discard them. You might find a thick layer of oil floating on top of the soup (depending on the fattiness of the beef). Use a ladle to skim the oil off according to your preference (see footnote 3).
Boil hand pulled noodles. If you aren’t making hand pulled noodles, cook dried noodles according to instructions on the bag.
Prepare Chinese chili oil according to this recipe. You can use one from the supermarket, but I highly recommend you cook your own at home. It takes only 5 minutes, and freshly made chili oil is full of aroma and will make the dish shine.
Once the beef has cooled enough to handle, trim off any fat and discard it. Slice the lean part of the beef.
To assemble noodles
Add noodles to each serving bowl, then pour in the broth. Top noodles with beef slices, a few pieces of daikon radish, and some cilantro. Serve immediately with chili oil. Add 1/2 teaspoon to 2 teaspoons of chili oil according to personal taste.
To store leftovers
Store the beef broth and beef separate in air-tight containers in the fridge for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month. You can use the beef broth in a stew or soup, if you like. The beef can be used in a stir-fry or salad.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '856 g', 'calories': '604 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '32.2 g', 'proteinContent': '62.7 g', 'fatContent': '23.5 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '7.6 g', 'cholesterolContent': '121 mg', 'sodiumContent': '2420 mg', 'fiberContent': '3.6 g', 'sugarContent': '4 g'}",4.85,,Omnivore's Cookbook,220,6 serving(s)

Rub both sides of salmon with cayenne pepper, black pepper and sea salt. Allow salmon to sit at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes. Please note, the surface of salmon will get moist again after salting. You should gently pat the salmon with a paper towel again, to remove moisture before cooking.
Combine Greek yogurt and Dijon mustard in a small bowl. Mix well and set aside.
Boil noodles according to directions. Rinse the boiled noodles under tap water, drain and set aside.
Add the oil into a nonstick skillet and place on medium high heat. When oil is hot, add Sichuan peppercorn and stir a few times until fragrant. Turn to low heat, carefully scoop out peppercorns with a spoon, and discard them. Turn back to medium high heat. (If you don’t use peppercorn, heat oil until hot before adding salmon.)
Place salmon into skillet, skin side down. Immediately press the filet against the skillet with a fish turner. (If you don’t have a fish turner, use a spatula to press against the thinner part of the fish) Hold the spatula for 20 to 30 seconds, until the skin part is cooked. Once the skin side has turned dark brown and crispy, after about 2 minutes, flip the salmon to cook the other side. If the salmon filet is thick, like the one in the picture below, you should cook the cut sides too, about 30 seconds on each. Adjust heat to medium or medium low, if the temperature of the skillet gets too high.
Insert a thermometer to test the temperature of the salmon. When the temperature registers 50 degrees C (120F), immediately transfer the salmon to a plate. Continue to cook the rest of salmon in the same manner. Quite a lot of grease will come out of the salmon during cooking, so you won’t need to add extra oil to cook the following pieces.
Place noodles on a large plate, add salmon on top, top with avocado slices, mustard yogurt and green onion. Serve immediately with mentsuyu. Drizzle mentsuyu on the noodles before eating.

Flip the fish and season the other side in the same manner, spray with oil. Stuff ginger slices and a few slices of onion in the cavity of the fish.
Bake on the middle rack until fish is cooked through, about 20 minutes (or longer time if you use a larger fish). You should be able to easily separate the flesh from the bone with a fork, and the internal temperature of the fish should be 62 degrees C (145 F).
While the fish is baking, chop the rest of the vegetables. Place lotus root, bamboo shoots, and mushrooms on a plate. Mix chili bean paste, black chili paste and Sichuan pickled peppers in a small bowl. Add dried chili pepper and chicken broth separately in two small bowls. Place the veggies, mixed sauce, peppercorns, dried chili pepper, chicken broth, salt and sugar on the kitchen counter, near the wok.

Method 1 - Use an Instant Pot

Once the pressure is released, uncover the pot, remove the chicken and place it onto a plate. Shred it with two forks.
Add the century eggs, green onion, sesame oil (if using), and the shredded chicken to the pot. Stir to mix well. Taste the congee and add salt if needed.
Method 2 - Stovetop method
Combine the rice, stock, and 2 cups of water in a big pot.
Cook over medium-high heat until bringing to a simmer. Turn to low heat. Cover the pot and leave a finger-wide a gap between the lid and the edge of the pot, to allow more steam to escape and prevent the congee from spilling or boiling over. Simmer for 25 minutes.
Add the chicken breast. Cook for another 15 minutes. Remove the chicken breast and place it onto a plate.
If the congee has reached the desired texture when the chicken breast is done, turn off the heat. Transfer the chicken onto a plate and shred it with two forks. If you want a stickier and thicker congee, remove the chicken first, then keep cooking the congee for another 15 to 20 minutes. Note, the congee will get quite thick and sticky towards the end. Stay nearby the pot and stir frequently.
When the congee reaches the desired texture, add back the shredded chicken. Add the century eggs, green onion, and sesame oil (if using) to the pot. Stir to mix well. Taste the congee and add salt to taste if needed.

Combine all the marinade ingredients in a bowl. Stir to mix well.
Remove the neck and giblets from the turkey cavity. Save them to make stock later or discard them.
Line a turkey bag over a large container *(Footnote 2). Place the turkey into the bag, neck side down.
Spread garlic and ginger in the turkey cavity, and stuff with white onions. Tie turkey legs together with twine, so the onions won’t fall out.
Pour the marinade on the inside and outside of the turkey. Carefully massage the bag to dispense the liquid evenly.
Try to squeeze as much air from from the bag as possible, and seal it with a clipper. Crumble and stuff old papers into the bottom of the container to lift the bag, so the marinade will rise higher and submerge 2/3 of the bird. Place the container into the fridge and let it marinate for 24 hours.
Once the breast side is marinated, transfer the container onto kitchen counter. Open the bag. Flip the turkey by lifting the legs with your one hand and use the other hand to hold the neck side. Squeeze the air from the bag and seal it. Rearrange the paper padding if necessary, to let the marinade submerge 1/3 of the bird. Place the container back into the fridge and let it marinate for 24 hours (or 12 hours if you’re in a hurry).
Prep for cooking
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 C).
Remove the turkey from the bag and place onto a big tray. Discard marinade liquid. Remove kitchen twine and discard the onions. Pat dry the turkey with a paper towel.
Remove the rind from the citrus. Cut into half if too large to fit into the turkey. I used lemon, orange, and grapefruit, but any other combination works too. Place the fruits into the turkey cavity.
Use toothpicks to seal the bottom of the turkey, so the fruits won’t fall out.
Use kitchen twine to tie turkey legs again. Pat dry turkey with paper towel again.
Prepare a roasting pan with rack inside. Brush a thin layer of olive oil thoroughly onto the top side (breast side). Move the turkey onto the roasting rack, breast side down. Brush a layer of olive oil onto the back side.
Cook
Place roasting pan at the bottom of the oven, or the position that allow the bird to sit right in the middle of the oven.
Bake at 400 F (200 C) for an hour.
Lower the oven temperature to 350 F (180 C). Cook for another 20 minutes to an hour for turkeys that are 14 pounds or larger (less time for smaller turkeys), or until the turkey back turns dark brown.
Remove from oven. Wear a pair oven mitts with several layers of paper towel on top, hold both ends of turkey and flip, so the breast side is up.
Insert a remote probe thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh, from the bottom of the turkey towards the breast in a horizontal position.
Return turkey to oven and set thermometer monitor alarm at 165 F (74 C) *(Footnote 3).
Once the turkey is done, remove it from the oven and use a instant thermometer to measure the other thigh and the thickest part of the breast. The breast should register 160 F (71 C).
Once the turkey is fully cooked, cover loosely with aluminum foil with a cross cut on top (*footnote 4). Rest for 30 minutes (up to 60 minutes).
Carve and serve.
How to make ahead and serve later
Let the turkey rest after cooking, then carve the turkey into legs, thighs, breasts, and wings. Do NOT slice the meat, as it results in dry turkey. Wrap the meat in aluminum foil, then seal in ziploc bags. Store in the fridge for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to a month.
You should thaw the turkey in the fridge a day before serving, so it defrosts completely.
To reheat, preheat the oven to 300 F (150 C), or 350 F (180 C) for faster heat up. Unwrap the aluminum foil and place the turkey and the foil on a baking sheet, skin side up.

Add whole wheat flour into a small bowl and set aside. Coat both hands with whole wheat flour, use one hand to further kneel the dough and the other hand to slowly rotate the bowl, till all liquid is absorbed by flour and the dough is formed, in around 10 minutes.
Dust a big cutting board with whole wheat flour and coat hands again. Pick the dough from the bowl and place on cutting board. Scratch off the dough that sticky to the bowl by a rubber spatula. Use both hands to kneel the dough until the the surface becomes smooth and the dough is elastic, in around 8-10 minutes. You should be able to pick up the dough by hands, but feeling it a bit sticky to the board when pick up. If the dough is still too sticky, add more flour, 1 teaspoon at a time, and kneel till flour is well mixed with the dough. Cover the dough with plastic wrap or with a wet clear kitchen towel.
Add olive oil into a small bowl and set aside. Grease baking dish (or plate) with olive oil and set aside. Dust both hands with whole wheat flour again. Equally divide the dough into 6-8 pieces(*see footnote 1) by knife. Gently kneel each dough by both hands and dust the dough with a thin layer of whole wheat flour, place in the glass dish. After all dough balls are done, drip several drops of olive oil on each dough ball and gently grease the ball with hand. Cover the glass dish with plastic wrap and place in fridge for overnight.(*see footnote 2)
(Option) After storing the dough in fridge overnight, the dough will turn slightly bigger, as the image shows below. If you want to save the dough for later use. After storage in fridge overnight, take the dough out, mist it with a thin layer of olive oil again, and place into ziplock bag. Store in the freezer up to 3 months(*see footnote 3).
The day when you want to make pizza, take pizza dough out of fridge for at least 2 hours before baking. If take from freezer, take out the dough out earlier, or transfer the dough in to fridge at least a day earlier(*see footnote 3). Dust a cutting board and both hands with whole wheat flour. Gently take the dough out and dust it with whole wheat flour, place it on the cutting board. Gently press the dough into a flat round disk, about 1.5 centimeters (1 inch) thick. Cover it with a plastic wrap or a plate, to keep the dough from dry out. Let the dough rest in room temperature.
Preheat pizza stone on lower level of oven to the highest temperature 40 minutes before baking pizza (*see footnote 4), mine is 220 degrees C (430F). If you don't using pizza stone, assemble pizza on baking tray directly (*see footnote 5). Right before assembling pizza, dust both hands again (dust whole hands, including back sides) and dust a pizza peel (or oven tray) with flour (*see footnote 6). Pick out the pizza dough and slowly toss and rotate it with both hands to enlarge the dough. You can also use both hands to pick up one side of dough to let the gravity stretch it, then rotate, and stretch other sides. when the dough is getting thinner and become difficult to toss, place it on pizza peel (or baking tray). Stretch it gently to thinner till the thickness you like.
Assemble pizza with sauce and toppings you like. Do not put too much toppings on the dough to shape like a small mountain, it will prevent the dough to rise during baking. Always top with a thin layer of sauce, and place 3 to 4 topping sparsely. Slide pizza into oven from pizza peel onto pizza stone and bake until crust turns golden, cheese is melt and start turning golden brown, in about 15 minutes under 220 degress C (430F) or less to 5 minutes by using higher temperature.

If you’re using bone-in chicken thighs, remove the bones using a knife. You don’t need to remove the bones if using the oven baking method.
Use the back of your knife (or a meat hammer) to pound the thicker part of the thigh, so the thigh will be cooked more evenly.
Marinate (Optional)
Skip this step if you’re using the oven method. Pour the Shaoxing wine into a big plate. Spread the chicken onto the plate, skin-side-up, so the meat side will be submerged in the wine. Sprinkle salt on the skin. Let marinate for 30 minutes to 1 hour at room temperature. Or cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the fridge up to overnight.
Teriyaki sauce
Mix the Shaoxing wine, soy sauce, brown sugar, and 1/4 cup water in a medium-sized bowl.
Heat 1 teaspoon oil in a small saucepan over medium heat until hot. Add the ginger, garlic, and the white part of the green onion. Stir a few times to release the fragrance.
Add the sauce. Make sure to scrape the bottom of your bowl to transfer all the sugar to the pan. Turn to medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally until the sauce is reduced by half, 5 to 6 minutes.
Whisk the cornstarch with the remaining 2 tablespoons of water. Stir to dissolve the cornstarch completely. Pour into the saucepan and stir to thicken it, until it can coat the back of a spoon.
Once done, transfer everything to a small bowl.
Cook chicken
Thoroughly pat chicken dry with kitchen paper towels (very important).
If you skipped the marinating process, Lightly season both sides of the chicken with salt before cooking.
Option 1 - Cook in an air-fryer
Set your air-fryer temperature to 390 F (198 C) and preheat air-fryer for 6 minutes or so.
Lightly grease the meat side of the chicken with a thin layer of oil to prevent sticking. Spread the chicken into the air-fryer basket skin-side-up without overlapping. You probably need to cook the chicken in two batches. Cook until the skin turns golden brown, 10 minutes or so. Remove the chicken and slice the thickest part to check the doneness. If you’ve pounded the chicken thin, the chicken should have cooked through. If the inside is still pink, return the chicken to the air-fryer, skin-side-down, and continue to cook 2 to 4 minutes, until the inside turns completely white.
Option 2 - Cook in a frying pan
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large pan over medium-high heat until hot. Spread the chicken skin-side-down without overlapping. Gently use your spatula to press down on the chicken, so the skin will cook evenly. After 2 minutes, cover pan with a lid. Continue to cook another 2 minutes or so, until the skin turns golden brown. Turn the heat to medium or medium-low if the pan gets too hot.
Flip the chicken and cover again. Cook for another 3 to 4 minutes, until the bottom turns crispy and the chicken is cooked through.
Option 3 - Cook in the oven
Preheat oven to 220 C (425 F) on convect mode (if available). Add 1/4 cup Shaoxing wine to a 9” x 9” baking dish. Add chicken thighs to baking dish, skin-side-up. Arrange them to expose more skin and avoid overlapping. Bake until the skin is crispy and a thermometer inserted near the bone reads 165 F, about 30 minutes.
Assemble

Make sure there is some space between the water level and the lip of the pot to avoid boiling over and to make skimming easier.
Add the green onions and ginger. Cook over high heat until the water reaches a full boil. Boil for 5 minutes, using a fine mesh strainer (or a ladle) to skim and discard the brown foam from the top, until the liquid is clear.
Strain the pork and reserve the blanching liquid. Rinse the pork with running tap water to stop the cooking and rinse away any scum that may have stuck to it.
In a separate medium-sized dutch oven or pot (make sure it is completely dry to avoid the oil and sugar splattering), add the sugar and oil. Heat over low heat until the sugar is melted and begins to brown; look for an amber color. Try to avoid stirring the sugar while melting it. Instead, swirl the whole pot.
Once the caramel is a light amber color, carefully add the pork chunks by gently placing them into the caramel to minimize splashing or splattering. Depending on the size of your pot, you might need to add the pork in two batches.
Turn the heat up to medium-low and brown the pork in the caramel, about 1 minute on each side. Be careful not to burn the sugar.
Add the cooking wine and scrape with a wooden spatula to release any brown bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the reserved blanching liquid, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, ginger, green onions, and star anise.
Turn to medium-high heat until the broth comes to a boil. Turn to medium-low or low heat so the broth reduces to a simmer. Cover the pot, leaving a finger-width gap to allow the steam to escape. Simmer for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Stir 2 to 3 times during the simmering.
If the pork has turned tender but the sauce isn’t fully reduced, remove the lid and bring the heat up to medium. Cook for another 10 or 15 minutes, until the liquid is reduced to a glaze consistency. Keep an eye on the pot during the process and stir to prevent burning on the bottom.
Serve the pork with the glaze over steamed rice as a main course.
You can store the leftovers in a sealed container in the fridge for 4 to 5 days or in the freezer for a month. To reheat the frozen pork, thaw it in the fridge overnight, then steam it until fully heated through, 15 to 20 minutes.

Easy Hand-Pulled Noodles,Maggie Zhu,https://omnivorescookbook.com/recipes/hand-pulled-noodles/,Chinese,https://omnivorescookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/200702_Hand-Pulled-Noodles_550.jpg,"['400 g (2 2/3 cup) all-purpose flour ((*Footnote 1))', '2 g (1/2 teaspoon) salt', '220 ml (1 cup minus 1 tablespoon) water (, room temperature)', 'Vegetable oil to coat the dough']","Make the dough by hand
Combine the water and salt in a small bowl. Stir to dissolve the salt.
Add the flour into a large bowl. Bit by bit, pour the water into the flour, mixing with a pair of chopsticks or a spatula as you go.
Once all the water is added, the dough should be in shaggy threads with little/no dry flour in the bowl. Begin pressing the dough together. If you find the dough is too dry and there’s still dry flour that’s hard to incorporate into the dough, drizzle more water onto the dry flour and mix it again, until there’s no dry flour left. Knead the dough until a rough, firm ball is formed, about 2 minutes.
Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest for 20 minutes.
Once the dough is rested, knead it again until it becomes smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.
Make the dough using KitchenAid
Mix the flour and salt in the bowl of the KitchenAid mixer and add the dough hook. Turn it to the mix setting. Slowly drizzle the water down the side, all along the bowl. This should take about 1 minute. Once the water is incorporated, turn to setting 2 and knead until a rough dough ball is formed, another 2-3 minutes.
Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest for 20 minutes.
Either knead in the machine on setting 4 for 30 seconds or by hand for 1-2 minutes.
If you plan to store/freeze the dough, coat the dough with oil and store it in a sealed plastic bag. Refrigerate for up to 2 days or freeze for up to 3 months.
Shape the dough
FOR THIN NOODLES: Divide the dough to halves and roll each dough into a 1/2” (1 cm) thick oval.
FOR FLAT NOODLES: Divide the dough to halves and roll each and roll each dough into a 1/4” (1/2 cm) thick oval.
FOR WIDE NOODLES: Cut the dough into 8 pieces. Roll each piece into approximately 3”x5” (8x13 cm) ovals, 1/4” (1/2 cm) high.
Coat the dough(s) generously with oil and cover with plastic. Let rest for 2 hours.
Pull and cook the noodles
Bring a medium-sized pot of water to a boil.
FOR THIN NOODLES: Cut long the longer side of the oval, slicing the dough into 1/2” (1 cm) wide strips and rolling each piece slightly to the side with each cut to prevent them from sticking together. Cover the cut pieces with the plastic again to prevent them from drying out. Starting with the first strip you cut off, pick it up on both ends. (*Footnote 2) In one swift motion, tug the noodle about an arm’s length and gently bounce it on the working surface once or twice until it forms a long, thin noodle. Rest the noodle on your working surface as you fold it over, so that both ends are in one hand. Hook the other side with your thumb. Give it a couple light tugs and bounces until the noodles get longer and reach the desired thin shape. Then pull off the thick ends collected in one hand and lay the noodle out on the working surface. Repeat with the rest of your noodles.
FOR FLAT NOODLES: Cut along the longer side of the oval, slicing the dough into 1 1/2” (3 cm) wide strips. Cover the cut pieces with the plastic again to prevent from drying out. Starting with the first strip you cut off, pick it up on both ends. (*Footnote 2) In one swift motion, tug the noodle to about an arm’s length and gently bounce it on the working surface once or twice. Rest the noodle on your working surface for 10-20 seconds, then give it a couple extra-light tugs and bounces until it forms a flat long noodle. Then pull off the thick ends and lay the noodle out. Repeat with the rest of your noodles. Drop the noodles into the boiling water, a few at a time, and cook for 1 to 1.5 minutes.
FOR WIDE NOODLES: One at a time, grip the short ends of a strip (*Footnote 2) and pull it apart in one swift motion until the dough feels taut. It should be between 1 to 2 feet. Bounce it on the table a couple times. Pull off the thick ends and lay the noodle out, covering it with plastic to prevent drying out.
Cook the noodles
Drop the noodles, a few pieces at a time, into the boiling water and cook for 1 to 1.5 minutes, until tender but still with a chewy texture. Do not cook too many noodles at a time! It’s hard to control the texture that way and the noodles might stick together.
Storage
Store the cooked noodles: If you plan on reheating, you can slightly undercook the noodles (to al dente) to create a better texture once reheated. Store the noodles in an airtight container or a ziplock bag in the fridge for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.
For frozen/refrigerated dough; let the frozen dough thaw in the fridge overnight. Transfer the refrigerated dough to room temperature. Rest for 2 hours. The dough will become super soft and can be gently shaped, rested for another 10 minutes or so, and pulled. Cook according to the instructions above.
Reheating cooked noodles
To reheat, bring a pot of water to a boil and add the cooked noodles. Separate with a pair of chopsticks and cook until the noodles are just heated through.
For a quicker and lazier reheating method (for leftovers), reheat the refrigerated noodles in the microwave until heated, then quickly rinse the noodles with tap water in a colander. Drain the water thoroughly before serving.
If you plan to use the thin noodles for fried noodles, you don’t need to reheat them before using. Thaw them if frozen. Then run the noodles with tap water in a colander and separate gently with chopsticks. Drain thoroughly before using for stir fried noodles.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 serving', 'calories': '187 kcal', 'carbohydrateContent': '38.2 g', 'proteinContent': '5.2 g', 'fatContent': '1.1 g', 'saturatedFatContent': '0.2 g', 'sodiumContent': '99 mg', 'fiberContent': '1.4 g', 'sugarContent': '0.1 g'}",4.85,,Omnivore's Cookbook,162,4 serving(s)

Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 C). Line a baking tray with parchment.
Press the water out of the tofu while heating up the oven. Carefully press the tofu with your hands. Slice the tofu into two even-thickness pieces.

Add everything into a mixer and mix until it forms a smooth sauce. You can also add everything into a deep cup and use a hand blender to mix the sauce.
The sauce is ready to use now.
You can store the leftover sauce in an airtight jar in the fridge for up to 5 days. The leftover sauce will taste even better.
Assemble
While baking the tofu, preheat the tortillas. Place tortillas in two stacks (4 pieces per stack) and wrap with aluminum foil. Bake on the bottom rack of the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until heated through.
Assemble the tacos by adding the baked tofu, avocado, and cherry tomatoes into the tortillas. Add peppers according to your spiciness tolerance. Add 2 tablespoons of no-fat creamy Sriracha sauce and drizzle with lime juice. Garnish with cilantro.

Let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes while you prepare other ingredients.
Preheat oven to 220 degrees C (425 degree F).
Prepare a roasting pan. Spread out the carrot, leek, white onion and garlic. Add chicken stock.
Combine all the ingredients for the hoisin butter sauce into a food processor. Puree until it becomes a fine paste. If you don’t have a food processor, finely chop garlic, green onion, shallot, and ginger. Mix everything together by using a mortar and pestle to form a paste.
Separate the skin from the turkey breast by gently sliding your finger between the meat and the skin. Try not to tear the skin. Leave the edges attached, so it shape a pocket to hold the butter. If you cannot stuff all the butter in, save the rest to use later (as chicken marinade or sauce).
Pour the paste in between the skin and the meat. Press your finger on top of the skin to distribute the paste evenly underneath. Sprinkle sea salt on both sides of the turkey breast.
Place the turkey breast onto the roasting pan with vegetables. Bake until the internal temperature reaches 60 degrees C (140 F), 50 minutes to 1 hour. The residue heat will keep cooking the turkey while resting.
Once the turkey is cooked through, remove it from the roasting pan and place onto a plate. Loosely cover with foil and let rest for 15 to 30 minutes.
Gravy
Strain the liquid from the roasting pan into a big measuring cup. Discard the solid ingredients. Skin off the fat with a ladle and discard, if needed. Reserve the juice. Add more stock, so you should have 2 cups of stock in total.
Add butter into a saucepan and cook over medium heat until melted. Turn to medium low heat. Whisk in flour. Stir and cook until golden brown.
Gradually add turkey drippings and stock, keep stirring, until it forms a silky paste. Cook until boiling before adding more turkey drippings, so the gravy won’t separate. Once the turkey drippings are added, bring to a light boil. Let simmer and cook until it reduces to 3 cups, after 10 to 15 minutes.

Gently rinse the dried lily flower buds, wood ear mushrooms, and shiitake mushrooms with tap water and transfer them into three bowls. Add 1/2 cup hot water to each bowl to cover. Let soak until tender throughout, 30 minutes or so. Once done, squeeze out the marinating liquid back into the bowls and gently rinse them with tap water again to remove any dust on the surface. Slice the shitake mushrooms. Cut the lily flowers in half. And chop the wood ear mushrooms into small pieces. Reserve the marinating liquid from the shiitake mushrooms and lily flowers for the gravy.
Prepare gravy
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the Sichuan peppercorns. Cook, stirring occasionally, until you can smell a strong fragrance and the peppercorns turn darker (but not black). Scoop out the Sichuan peppercorns and discard them (*Footnote 1).
Add the rehydrated lily flowers, shiitake mushrooms, and wood ear mushrooms. Cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute or so. Be careful, the rehydrated ingredients might cause oil splatter.
Add the white part of the green onion and the ginger. Cook and stir for 30 seconds to release the fragrance.
Move everything to one side of the pan and add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon oil to the other side. Add the ground pork on top of the oil, then use a spatula to spread it out. Let the pork cook for a minute without moving to brown the bottom, then cut it into small pieces.
When the pork is cooked through, pour in the Shaoxing wine and scrape the pan to release any brown bits.
Pour in the light soy sauce and dark soy sauce. Stir to coat well.
Add the water and the reserved 1 cup of soaking water. And the chicken bouillon powder. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally, and cook for 2 minutes.
Meanwhile, dissolve the cornstarch in 1 tablespoon of water in a small bowl. Pour the cornstarch slurry into the pan. Stir to mix well and let cook until the sauce thickens. Taste the gravy and adjust the seasoning by adding a pinch of salt, if needed.
Serve
To serve, scoop the tofu pudding using a large spoon (the larger and flatter, the better) into two serving bowls.

Prep
Add the cumin, Sichuan peppercorns, and coriander to a dry pan and heat over medium-low heat. Stir and toss frequently. Toast until the spices are fragrant and beginning to pop, about 5 minutes. Take the spices off the heat and grind until partially powdered. You can use a mortar & pestle, a spice grinder, a coffee grinder, or by crushing the spices with the bottom of a heavy pan.
Combine the lamb, Shaoxing wine, salt, oil, and 2 teaspoons of the ground spices and mix. Add the cornstarch and mix by hand until the lamb is fully coated. Marinate for 15 minutes.
Cook lamb sauce
Add the oil to a large skillet and heat over high heat until the oil begins to smoke. Add the marinated lamb and spread it into a single layer. Separate the individual slices with minimal overlapping using a pair of tongs or chopsticks. Add the garlic and ginger on top. Leave the lamb to sear for 30 seconds to a minute until the bottom is browned.
Once the lamb is browned on one side, stir occasionally until the lamb is mostly browned on both sides and the aromatics begin to turn golden. It’s OK if the inside of the lamb is still slightly pink.
Add the red onion and green chilis. Stir fry for 10 to 20 seconds.
Add the spice mix and toss to coat everything with the spices.

Add the mushrooms into a medium-sized bowl and add 1/2 cup boiling water to cover. Make sure the mushrooms are submerged. Let rehydrate until the mushrooms turn soft, 15 to 20 minutes. Cut and prepare the other ingredients in the meantime. Once the mushrooms are done soaking, squeeze out the excess liquid and slice into strips. Reserve the soaking liquid.
Boil and cool the broth
Combine all the broth ingredients plus 3 tablespoons of mushroom soaking liquid in a small pot. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat and stir to dissolve the sugar. Remove the pot from the heat and set aside to cool completely.
Prepare the filling
Mix the filling sauce ingredients with 1 tablespoon of the mushroom soaking liquid in a small bowl. Stir to mix well.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat until hot. Add the ginger and stir for 30 seconds, until it smells fragrant.
Add the rehydrated sliced shiitakes, carrots, and bamboo shoots. Cook and stir for another minute.
Pour in the sauce. Cook and stir until it is absorbed into the vegetables and the carrots are softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer everything to a big plate and set aside.
Assemble the loaf
Remove the tofu sheet from the package, remove 3 sheets from the stack, and keep them stacked and folded in half. Using a pair of kitchen shears, cut the uneven hard edges from the tofu sheets, and place the cut-off edges into the broth. Then slice the sheets in half so that you have 6 semi-circles.
Lay one semi-circle on a large clean work surface, so that the straight edge is facing left. Gather the cut edges from the broth with a pair of tongs. Use them to wipe a generous layer of broth onto the tofu sheet (it will be absorbed by the tofu), returning the edges to the broth when you are done. Lay another semi-circle over the first, this time with its straight edge facing right so that a rectangle-like shape is formed. Wipe the top layer of the tofu sheet with the broth in the same way you did with the previous layer. Repeat these steps, switching between laying the sheet right or left, until all the semi-circles are used. (See the blog post above for the step-by-step pictures.)
Squeeze most of the broth out of the edges and place them at the base (closest to you) of the rectangle, leaving 2” (5 cm) at the bottom and to both sides. Layer all the vegetable filling over the edges. When you’re doing this step, it’s important to make sure the length of the filling is shorter than the frying pan you will use later for the frying. (*Footnote 1)
Starting from the bottom, roll the sheets over the filling. Squeeze and tuck it tightly and continue to roll until the filling is fully covered. Then fold both sides inwards. Continue to roll so that they are tucked in. Once done, place the roll seam side down and you will have a loaf.
Cook the loaf
Prepare a steamer by adding water and bringing it to a boil. Place the loaf on the steaming rack. Steam covered for 8 minutes over high or medium-high heat. Once done, carefully remove the loaf from the steamer. Place it on a rack to let it drain.
Prepare a plate or a tray and top it with a wire rack.
Prepare a high-walled pan or pot that is large enough to fit the roll. Add enough oil so it would cover half of the loaf (but don’t put the loaf in yet). Heat over medium heat until it reaches 350°F (176°C). Gently lower the roll in with the seam side down. You can do this using a pair of tongs with the help of a spatula. Fry 2 to 3 minutes per side, until the roll turns golden brown all over. Carefully remove the loaf from the oil onto a rack to let drain briefly. Then transfer to a high-walled dish. Let rest for 5 minutes.
Before serving, drizzle the remaining broth over the roll.

Strain the short ribs off (reserving some of the resulting stock for later just in case) and rinse them to remove any residue and to cool them down. If any piece has a large amount of excess fat on it, you can trim that off now. Add them to the Instant Pot.
Combine all the sauce ingredients in a blender and blend on high until the sauce is as smooth as possible. Pour the sauce over the short ribs and seal the Instant Pot.

Add the dried shiitake mushrooms into a small bowl and pour in 1 cup of boiling water. Rehydrate for at least 20 minutes, or until the mushrooms turn tender throughout. Once rehydrated, remove the shiitakes from their soaking liquid, squeezing out the extra water. Slice them into 3/4”(1 cm) strips. Reserve the soaking liquid.
Cut the pork belly into thin slices, about 1/4”(1/2 cm) thick. Then cut into thin strips, about 1/4” (1/2 cm) thick. Transfer the pork belly into a medium-sized bowl. Add the Shaoxing wine and dark soy sauce. Mix well. Let marinate for 20 to 30 minutes.
Fry the shallots (Optional)
(Skip this step if using pre-fried shallots) While the pork is marinating, heat a 9” cast iron pan (or heavy-bottomed pan) over medium-low heat and add the 1/2 cup oil. Once the oil has reached around 200 to 250°F (93 to 120°C), add the shallots. Fry for around 5 minutes, then add the garlic. Fry for another 10 minutes, or until the shallots and garlic turn golden and crispy. (*Footnote 2) If some of the bits brown faster, fish them out using a slotted spoon, to prevent overcooking. Once done cooking, strain everything from the oil and set aside. Pour the oil from the pan into a heat-proof bowl, leaving a thin layer of oil in the pan. (You can save the aromatic oil to use in other recipes)
Braise the pork
Return the oiled pan to medium heat and add the marinated pork belly. Stir fry until the meat is lightly browned, about 5 minutes.
Pour in the shaoxing wine and scrape the pan with a spatula to release any brown bits. Add the soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, star anise, cinnamon stick, crispy shallots, and shiitake mushrooms. Stir fry for 30 seconds, until everything is mixed together and well coated.
Add the cup of mushroom soaking liquid (being careful not to add the sediment at the bottom) and 1 cup of water.
Bring to a boil over medium-high heat then reduce to low heat. Simmer until the meat is tender and the liquid is reduced to a thin sauce, about 1 hour 30 minutes. Depending on your stove, the braising time might vary a lot. Check on the pork at the 1-hour mark, and stop cooking if the pork has turned tender and the sauce thickened.
Once the meat is set to a simmer, boil 4 eggs by bringing a pot of water to a boil, then adding the eggs to cook for 10 minutes. Run the cooked eggs under cold water to stop the cooking. Peel the eggs and add them to the braising pork during the last 30 minutes of braising.

Add 4 cups of water and the rest of the brine ingredients into a blender and blend until the aromatics are chopped and the salt and sugar are dissolved.
Pour the blended mixture into a large bowl that can hold 10 cups of water, and add the remaining 6 cups of water.
Add the raw chicken into the brine and make sure it is fully submerged. Allow it to brine in the fridge overnight, up to 24 hours, or brine at room temperature for a minimum of 4 hours.
Cook
Add the chicken broth, ginger, garlic, and chilis into the Instant Pot. Add the steaming rack. Pull the chicken out of the brine and place it onto the rack, breast side up.
Seal the Instant Pot and set to pressure cook for 25 minutes, or 6 minutes per pound of chicken. After cooking, allow the Instant Pot to release the pressure naturally for 15 minutes.
While the chicken cooks, set your oven to 500°F and prepare a roasting pan with a rack.

Gravy
Prepare the gravy while resting the chicken. Transfer the liquid from the Instant Pot to a 4-cup measuring cup. You should get more than 2 cups of chicken broth. Skim the oil on top using a large spoon and transfer it to a small saucepan. You will need 2 tablespoons for the gravy.

Let it sit while you prepare the other ingredients so the black beans will soften, 5 minutes or so. Once the fermented black beans turn soft, smash them with the back of a spoon to thicken the paste. It’s fine if you cannot smash the beans evenly and completely. Once done, add the rest of the sauce ingredients and mix well.
Line a large dutch oven or heavy-duty pot with parchment paper and make sure you have about 8” (20cof paper poking out of the pot, so you can wrap up the ingredients later.
Spread the onion onto the bottom of the lined dutch oven. Place the fish on top of the onion, skin-side-down. Arrange the asparagus between the salmon fillets. Pour the black bean sauce over the salmon. Drizzle the olive oil and sprinkle the green onion over the salmon and asparagus.
Fold the paper over to cover the fish and crimp the edges loosely together so it forms a pocket to hold all the ingredients. Add 1/2 cup water outside of the parchment paper, and make sure the water doesn’t enter the paper pocket and dilute the sauce.
Cover the dutch oven with the lid. Cook over medium-high heat until the water boils, 5 minutes or so. Do not uncover the lid during the process. You should hear the water bubble when it starts to boil. Reduce the heat to medium or medium-low. Continue to cook for another 6-10 minutes depending on the thickness of the fish and the doneness you’re looking for. After 6 minutes, uncover the pot and unfold the parchment paper using a pair of tongs (be careful of the hot steam coming out of the pot). Test the doneness of the salmon by inserting a fork into the thickest part of the fillet. It should flake easily and the color should be pale pink throughout. If the salmon is mostly cooked but still has spots of darker pink, cover the pot again, remove it from the stove, and let sit for 3 to 4 minutes. If the salmon doesn’t flake easily, return it to cook on the stove for longer until it’s done.
Once the salmon is cooked, remove the pot from the stove immediately and uncover the pot. Let the steam out for a minute, remove the lid, and carefully open the paper. Transfer the salmon with the onions and asparagus onto a serving plate. Transfer the remaining sauce as much as possible onto the salmon using a spoon.

Lightly dust the inside of the chicken with 1/2 tsp of five spice powder.
In a large ziploc bag, combine the marinade ingredients and mix well. Add the chicken. Massage a few times so the chicken is evenly coated with the marinade. Marinate for a minimum of 4 hours, up to overnight. (Preferably overnight)
Prior cooking
Remove the chicken from the fridge 30 minutes prior to cooking. Transfer the chicken from the ziploc bag to a big plate. Remove the ginger from the marinade and add it to the cavity of the chicken. Reserve the marinade for cooking the basting sauce.
Basting sauce
Transfer the leftover marinade into a small pot. Cook it on the stove stop over medium-low heat for 5-10 minutes.
Add the maple syrup (or honey) at the end and remove the pot from the stove. Set aside for basting the chicken at the end of baking.
Roast chicken
Preheat oven to 350F (177C).
Set up a baking tray with an adjustable roasting rack (highly recommended, or a regular grilling rack) and set the chicken on it. If you don’t have a rack, you can crumple up foil balls and set the chicken on them. Or alternatively, you can cut onions into big pieces and set the chicken on top
If you are using a probe digital thermometer, insert it into the thickest part of the chicken, usually into the thigh without touching the bone. (Not between the leg and the thigh, but the thigh itself)
After 20 minutes, you should see oil drippings. Baste the chicken with the oil every 20 minutes or so, for an hour. If you don’t get any oil drippings, you can use 1-2 tablespoon of oil.
For the last 30 minutes, start basting it every 10-15 minutes with the basting sauce. Note, make sure to close the oven door every time you’re basting the chicken, to prevent the oven temperature from dropping too much. The total baking time can range from 1 hour and 20 minutes (for a small chicken under 3 lbs / 1.4 kg) up to 2 hours (for a big chicken that’s 5 lbs / 2.3 kg).
Remove the chicken when the internal temperature hits 165F (74C). If you don’t have a thermometer, slice the skin between the chicken thigh and body cavity. You should be able to pull the thigh easily from the body and the chicken meat near the joint should be white. If the chicken is not cooked, return it to the oven and let it cook until cooked through.
Once done, let the chicken rest for 15 minutes before carving.

Using a meat tenderizer or the back of a heavy knife, beat the pork chops until they are 1/4” (1/2 cm) thick. (Optional: cut 4 or 5 slits along the edge of the pork chops. This will help prevent the pork chops from curling while cooking). Spread the pork chops into a large ziplock bag (gallon bags work the best) with as little overlapping as possible. Or you can use appropriately sized tupperware containers.
Mix the marinade ingredients in a small bowl and stir to combine. If you do not use a ziplock bag, you need to double the marinade so you have enough to cover the pork. Pour the marinade over the pork chops. Squeeze out as much air as possible from the bag and seal it. Massage the bag so that the marinade covers all sides. Marinate in the fridge for 2 to 4 hours. (*Footnote 4)
Deep frying
Add 2” (5 cm) oil into a tall pan (or a fryer) that’s just big enough to fit the pork. Heat the oil to 350°F (176°C) over medium-high heat. Add the sweet potato starch onto a plate and spread it into an even layer. Prepare a rack-lined tray or a plate with a paper towel.
Remove the pork chops from the marinade but do not dry them off. One at a time, lay a pork chop into the starch and press down gently, then flip and press again. Scoop the starch around the edges and over any bare spots and press lightly so that the chop is fully coated. Shake off the excess starch from the pork.
Gently lower the pork chop into the oil. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until the chop is just becoming golden brown, flipping occasionally for even cooking and color. Remove the chop and lay it on the rack or towel-lined plate. Repeat with the remaining chops. Note, the oil temperature might drop after frying. It’s the best to measure the temperature after frying each chop and reheat the oil in between if needed, to produce a consistent result.
Once all the chops are cooked, bring the oil up to 375°F (190°C). Starting with the first chop that was fried, fry the chops again for 1 minute each, until they reach a deep golden brown color. Transfer the chops to the cooling rack or a fresh paper towel again.
Allow the refried chops to cool slightly. Then slice and serve hot as a main dish.
Store and reheat
To store the pork chops, let them cool completely before transferring them to a container. Store them in the fridge for up to 4 days or in the freezer for up to 2 months.
To reheat the refrigerated pork chops, place them in a 450°F (230°C) oven until heated through, 5 minutes or so. Flip once in between. Or you can reheat them in an air fryer.

Add the shredded coconut to a small pan and heat over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown. Transfer to a small bowl and set aside.
Combine the tamarind paste with 1/4 cup of hot water in a small bowl. Let soak until very tender. When you’re ready to use the paste, press and stir the paste to mix it with the water and squeeze out the tamarind pods. Discard the pods before using.
Blend together curry paste ingredients, adding just enough water (or stock) to allow to blend properly.
Cook
Add the oil to a 3.5 quart pot and heat over medium heat. Add the curry paste and turn to medium-low heat. Cook and stir until the moisture is reduced and the paste begins to caramelize, 8 minutes or so.
Add the cardamom pod, cloves, and star anise pods. Cook and stir for 1 minute to release the fragrance.
Add the beef and the leftover upper portions of the lemongrass stalks. Turn to medium heat. Cook and stir for 1 minute, until the beef is evenly coated.
Add the coconut milk and soaked tamarind water (do not add the leftover tamarind chunks). Bring to a simmer. Reduce to low or very low heat, whichever is enough to maintain the very low simmer. Add the toasted shredded coconut, kaffir lime leaves, brown sugar, and salt. Stir a few times to mix well.
Cover the pot but leave a small gap about the width of your finger. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the beef turns very tender. The process can take anywhere from 2 to 3.5 hours. When the braising liquid starts to turn golden brown, check on the pot more often, every 15 minutes or so, and stir and scrape the bottom to prevent burning. At the end of cooking, the curry will turn golden brown and the oil will separate. Depending on the cut you use, it might end up with a lot of oil. You can skim the oil with a spoon and discard it before serving. Taste the beef and the curry. Adjust the seasoning by adding salt, if needed.

Place the chicken in a gallon-size ziplock bag. Carefully pour the cooled marinade mixture into the bag with all the ingredients. Seal the bag and squeeze out as much as air possible. Massage the bag a few times to evenly distribute the marinade. Place the bag in a large deep bowl so it “pushes” the marinade to fully cover the chicken. Plus the marinade won’t cause a mess if your bag accidently leaks. You can marinate the chicken in a large bowl, too. In this case, you might need to flip the chicken 2 to 3 times during the marinating process. Cover with a plastic bag if using a bowl. Let marinate overnight.
Chose a pot that is deep and just wide enough to hold the chicken. Add the chicken into the pot, breast-side-up. Pour in all the marinade with the ingredients. If the chicken is not covered, add up to 4 cups water. It’s OK if a small part of the chicken breast is not covered in the liquid.
Bring to a boil over medium high heat. Turn to medium-low or low heat. Use a fine mesh strainer to skim the foam and discard. When the broth reduces to a simmer, cover the pot. Simmer for 25 minutes. Turn off the heat. Let the chicken sit in the hot broth, covered, for another 30 minutes, or until the chicken is just cooked. To test, you can either insert a thermometer into the thickest part of the thigh or slice the skin that attaches the thigh to the body: the root of the thigh should no longer be pink. Soak the chicken in the broth, covered, if the chicken is not cooked. If the chicken is still very raw, return the pot to a simmer and cook until the chicken is fully cooked.
Once done, carefully transfer the chicken onto a big plate and drain all the liquid from the cavity. I usually do this wearing one oven mitt with a few layers of paper towel, with the other hand using a pair of tongs. Let the chicken cool enough to handle with your hands. Carve the chicken and slice the parts you plan to serve. Reserve the liquid to use as dipping sauce, or for braising (try using it to braise daikon radish or potato - so delicious!).

Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C).
Right before cooking, pat the duck dry with paper towels. Score the skin 1/2-inch (1 cm) apart to a diamond pattern (but careful not to score the meat).
You might need to cook the duck in two batches. Place the breast pieces in a cold ovenproof 12-inch heavy skillet, skin-side down. Cook over medium heat, until they’re gently sizzling. Turn to medium-low heat. Cook until the skin turns golden brown, for another 10 to 12 minutes. Flip them over every 3 to 4 minutes. If the duck skin cooks too fast, turn to low heat. Transfer the cooked duck onto a plate and cook the rest using the same method.
Arrange all the duck pieces in the pan, skin- side down. Transfer the skillet into the oven and bake for 8 minutes, until the skin turns dark brown. Flip to skin-side up and bake for another 6 to 8 minutes, until the skin turns dark brown but not burnt. Transfer the duck onto a big plate, skin-side up. Allow to rest for 10 minutes without cover before carving.
Prepare the sides while resting the duck.
If you plan to serve the duck later, wrap each duck breast with aluminum foil when they are warm enough to handle and seal in a bag. Store in the fridge for up to 3 days. When you’re ready to serve, warm them up in a preheated 300°F (150°C) oven for 10 minutes.
Serving option 1 - Easy weekday dinner
Transfer 1 tablespoon rendered duck fat into a large skillet. Cook the sweet potato first over medium heat until it’s tender. Then add the zucchini and sprinkle with salt. Cook until the zucchini just turns tender and the sweet potato is almost caramelized. Transfer the ‘noodles’ to serving plates.
Slice the duck into thin slices and place on top of the vegetables, with plum sauce on the side.
Enjoy hot as a main dish.
Serving option 2 - Fancy Peking duck rolls
To serve Peking duck style, steam the pancakes in a bamboo steamer for 3 to 5 minutes until hot.
Slice the duck and place them on a plate. Serve with hot pancakes, sweet bean sauce (or hoisin sauce), cucumber and green onions on the side.
To assemble - place one pancake in the palm of your hand, brush some sauce on the pancake, place 2 to 3 slices duck in the center, top with a few strips of green onions and cucumber. Roll and tuck the pancake like a mini burrito. Repeat, and enjoy hot as a main dish.",en-US,"{'servingSize': '1 servings', 'calories': '194 kcal', 'sugarContent': '0.1 g', 'sodiumContent': '147 mg', 'fatContent': '9.4 g', 'carbohydrateContent': '0.3 g', 'fiberContent': '0.4 g', 'proteinContent': '27.2 g', 'cholesterolContent': '84 mg'}",4.94,,Omnivore's Cookbook,60,6 serving(s)

Rinse dried lily flowers with tap water. Place in a medium sized bowl and pour boiling water on top. Mix well and let rehydrate for 2 hours (up to overnight). After 1 hour, mix the lily flowers again, to make sure all flowers are soaked in water. After lily flowers turn soft, snip the tough ends by hand, and cut in half lengthwise. Drain and set aside. Save the re-hydrating water for later use.
Rinse shiitake mushrooms with tap water. Add to a small bowl and cover with tap water. Let sit for 2 hours, until the mushrooms turn soft. Gently squeeze the water from the mushrooms and transfer them to a plate. Save the re-hydrating water for later use.
Add dried wood ear mushroom in a small bowl and warm water to cover. Let sit for 2 hours, until the wood ear mushrooms turn soft. Gently rinse with tap water and drain. Cut into bite size.
Thirty minutes before cooking
Use a knife to slice each fried gluten ball, so it absorbs water faster. Place all the gluten balls in a large bowl and add water to cover. Place a cover (or a plate) on top of the bowl, so the gluten balls will be submerged in water. After 20 minutes, stir and mix with water again, to make sure all the gluten balls are soaked in water. After all the balls turn soft, squeeze water out and set aside. Discard the soaking water.
Chop vegetables and prepare the seasonings.
Place bean threads noodles in a bowl and add warm water to cover. Let sit for 5 minutes, until the noodles turn soft. Drain and set aside.
To cook the stew
Heat oil in a wok over medium high heat (or high heat on an electric stove). When oil is warm, add ginger and green onion. Stir a few times until fragrant. Add carrot. Stir and cook for 1 minute.

Place the flank steaks in a large baking dish, pour over half of the marinade, or just enough to cover half of the steak. Arrange the steaks carefully so the bottom side is well coated with the marinade. You should still have half or a third of the marinade left for the salad and dipping sauce. Let marinate in the fridge for at least 30 minutes but no more than 4 hours. Flip once. (*footnote 1)
Chop vegetables and mix the salad in a bowl while marinating the steak. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the fridge.
When the steak is ready to cook, remove the steak from marinade and pat dry with a paper towel. Discard the marinade. Brush the steak with a thin layer of oil. Lightly season both sides with sea salt.
To cook steak on a grill
Build a modified two zone fire and let the grill heat up.
Cook the steak on direct fire until the surface turns dark brown, about 3 to 4 minutes per side. Flip 2 to 3 times during grilling. Move the steak to the indirect zone and lift one side with a pair of tongs. Check doneness by inserting a thermometer into the thickest part of the steak: 51 degrees C (125F) for rare, 54 C (130 F) for medium rare or 57 C (135 F) for medium. Cook the steak more over direct heat if needed.
To cook steak on stove top
Heat a large cast iron pan or a heavy duty pan on high heat until hot. Place steak in the pan and sear for 2 to 3 minutes without moving, until the bottom side is browned. Check by lifting up a side of the steak to see if nicely browned. If so, flip the steak and sear the other side for 2 to 3 minutes. If you’re using a cast iron pan, remove the pan from the heat and let the steak continue to cook for 5 to 10 minutes on the residual heat. If you’re using other types of pan, place the pan over low heat and cook until it reaches the desired doneness.
serve & leftovers
Transfer the steak to a large plate and cover loosely with aluminium foil. Let sit 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
If you will serve the steak later, let it cool down a bit, wrap it with aluminum foil, and store it in the fridge. Gently heat up the steak in the oven at 93 degrees C (200 F) until warm.

Generously sprinkle salt on the surface and the inside of the chicken. Let marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes, or in the fridge for up to 6 hours.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 C). Position the oven rack to 1/3 of the way from the bottom of the oven, so the chicken will sit in the middle.
Spread the vegetables in a single layer in a large baking dish (I used a 13”x9” dish) (*Footnote 2)
Thoroughly pat the outside and inside of the chicken dry with paper towel. Brush a thin layer of oil onto the skin. Sprinkle dry rub generously on all sides of the chicken. Stuff the citrus into the cavity of the chicken. Tie chicken legs with kitchen twine and tuck the chicken wing tips underneath the wings. Place the chicken, breast-side-down onto the vegetables.
Bake for 30 minutes (20 minutes for a smaller bird). Carefully flip the chicken using one hand with an oven mitt on and a few layers of kitchen towel on top, and the other hand with a pair of tongs. Continue baking for another 20 minutes for a smaller chicken (under 4 pounds), and 30 to 40 minutes for a larger chicken (4 to 5 pounds). To test the doneness of the chicken, you can use a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh without touching the bones. It should read 160 F (the temperature will continue to rise to 165 F when you rest the chicken). Or you can slice the skin at the base of the thigh and pull the thigh. The juice should turn clear, and there should be no purple color on the meat, and the thigh should pull apart rather easily.
Transfer the chicken to a big plate and let rest for 10 minutes before carving.
(Optional) If you want the vegetables crispier, turn on the broiler and place the oven rack under the broiler. Bake for a few more minutes until the vegetables are slightly charred.

Light one chimney full of charcoal. When the charcoal at the top of the chimney is lit, put on heat resistant gloves and pour the charcoal over one side of the coal grate to create a moderate two-zone fire.

Preheat oven to 120°C (250°F). Line a baking pan with aluminium foil (for easy cleanup) and top with a V-rack.
Prepare a plate. Transfer the neck and giblets from the goose cavity to the plate, and save for making stock later. Use a pair of poultry shears to trim the neck skin. Do not trim any skin from the bottom of the goose, because it will keep the meat moist during roasting.
Place goose on a working surface or cutting board. Use a toothpick to prick the goose skin on the breast and the thigh without piercing the meat, as many times as possible or at least about 1/3 inch (1 cm) apart. Note, the thickness of goose skin is not consistent, so start slow and do not prick too deep. If the skin is too tough to prick through, let the goose rest at room temperature for 30 minutes, or use your hands to massage the skin to loosen it up.
Rub both sides and the inside of the goose with a generous amount of sea salt.
Stuff citrus inside the goose, using as many fruits as you can. Use a few toothpicks to seal the bottom of the goose, to secure the fruits inside. Place goose onto the V-rack, breast side up.
Bake until the skin turns golden brown, 8 to 10 hours. You do not need to flip the goose or monitor the process.
If you’re going to serve the goose immediately, turn up the heat to 260°C (500°F) to brown the goose for another 5 to 10 minutes.
If you’re going to serve the goose later, remove the goose from the oven. Place the goose in a cool place, loosely covered with aluminum foil, if you’re going to serve it the same day. Alternatively, you could let the goose rest for 30 minutes, then carve it into breast and leg pieces. Use aluminum foil to wrap the pieces, seal them in Ziplock bags, and store them in the fridge for up to 3 days.
Reheat goose
Thirty minutes before serving, heat oven to 200°C (400°F). Roast the whole goose for 30 minutes, or until the skin turns dark brown and crispy. If you have carved the goose, spread the pieces on an aluminum-foil-lined baking sheet, and bake until the skin turns crispy, 15 minutes or so.
Fruit sauce
While resting (or reheating) the goose, cook the fruit sauce. Dissolve potato starch in a few tablespoons of the sparkling wine.
Heat the rest of the sparking wine with the ginger powder in a small saucepan until bringing to a simmer. Turn to medium low heat and let simmer for 10 minutes so that the alcohol evaporates. Add the black currant jam and a pinch of salt. Stir and mix so that the jam incorporates with the wine. When the liquid comes to a simmer, taste it and adjust the flavor by adding more wine or jam.
Stir the cornstarch slurry again so that the starch fully dissolves. Slowly pour half of the slurry into the sauce, stirring at the same time. Continue adding more slurry to get the sauce to the desired thickness.
Serve
Remove the goose from the oven and let it rest for 15 to 30 minutes for an un-carved goose. You don’t need to rest it if you’ve already carved the goose. Do NOT cover the goose with foil. The stuffing will keep the meat hot.
Transfer the goose onto a large cutting board, carve, then slice the breast meat into bite-size pieces.

Add the sauce ingredients into a blender. Mix until it forms a smooth sauce.

Make the coleslaw
Mix the coleslaw ingredients in a large bowl. Pour half of the remaining sauce into the bowl. Mix well and set aside.

Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Place the salmon fillets skin-side-down on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper. Discard the marinade. Bake for 8 to 15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the salmon. Once done, the salmon should be just cooked through and flake easily. If you like the raw texture of the salmon, you can cook it for an even shorter time so the inside is still a bit pink.

Pour in the sauce. Stir to mix well. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Your pan should still have some sauce left, just enough to cover the beef. If not, you can gradually stir in more broth.
Meanwhile, whisk the cornstarch with 1/4 cup of water in a small bowl.
Once the beef is cooked, add the frozen peas. Stir the cornstarch slurry again to dissolve the powder completely, and pour half of the slurry into the pot. Stir to mix well. The broth should thicken and will able to coat the back of a spoon. If the broth is still very thin, keep adding more cornstarch slurry to the broth and stir constantly, until it thickens.
Crack 5 eggs onto the beef. Cover immediately and let it steam until the egg whites are cooked and the yolks are still runny, 2 to 3 minutes. Or you can cook the eggs to the degree you prefer.

(Option 1) Using a mixer: Add flour and turn on at low speed. Gradually add water. Let mix until the surface of the dough becomes smooth, about 8 minutes.
(Option 2) Kneading the dough by hand: Add flour to a large bowl. Gradually add water and whisk flour with a spatula until water is fully blended. Dust both hands with dry flour and knead the dough. If there is dry flour in the bowl that is difficult to blend into the dough, add a bit more water to the dry flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Knead until there is no dry flour left. The dough should feel springy and you should be able to easily pick it up without it sticking to the bottom of the bowl. Dust a working surface with dry flour and transfer the dough onto it. Knead until the surface of the dough turns smooth.
Wrap and seal the dough with plastic wrap. Let for 30 minutes up to 3 hours.
To make the filling
Prepare the filling while resting the dough. Combine ground beef, minced ginger, Shaoxing wine, light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and ground Sichuan peppercorn (or black pepper) in a big bowl. Mix well until the liquid ingredients are fully absorbed.
Prepare and cut vegetables, but do not add them to the ground beef yet.
Right before assembling the pies, add the onion, carrot, salt and sugar to the beef filling. Mix well. Add sesame oil and mix again. (*footnote 1)
To assemble the pies
Add oil to a small bowl and prepare a small brush. Dust both hands and a large cutting board with dry flour. Transfer the dough to the cutting board and knead for a few times. The dough should be a bit softer, springy, and smooth.
Divide the dough into two equal pieces and put one piece back in the bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Roll the other half into a ball. Press it into a flat circle. Use a rolling pin to roll it into a thin round disc, about 4 millimeters (1/8 inch) thick.
Brush a thin layer of oil on top. Sprinkle a pinch of salt over it and brush it again until evenly spread. Roll the round sheet into a long stick. Cut the stick into 6 equal pieces.
Work on the meat pies one at a time. Cover the rest of the dough with plastic wrap.
Pinch the two ends of each piece to seal the oil inside. Press the dough (the sealed ends are on the left and right) and gently roll it into a thin round disc. This step is help to create a layered crust.
Scoop 2 to 3 tablespoons of beef filling and place it on one side of the dough pancake, in a half-moon shape, as if making a quesadilla.
Fold the empty half over and press the edges together by hand. Turn the edge upward and press it again to further seal the pie.
Set pie aside and work on the rest of the dough in the same manner.
Cover the meat pies with plastic wrap while working on the rest of the pies, to prevent the dough from drying out.
To cook the pies
Heat a large nonstick skillet with 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat until warm. Transfer meat pies to the skillet without overlapping. Brush the top side with oil. Cover skillet and cook over low heat until the bottom side turns golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook the other side. Cover and cook until the bottom side turns golden brown, 3 minute. Transfer the meat pies to a plate. Cook the remainder of the meat pies the same way.
Serve warm with Chinese black vinegar. If the meat pie is not salty enough, blend 1 teaspoon light soy sauce with 1 tablespoon black vinegar as a dipping sauce.
To store the meat pie
Place meat pie in an airtight container. Store in the fridge up to 3 days or in the freezer for 1 month.
To reheat the meat pie. Heat oil in a skillet until warm. Add meat pies. When the skillet is hot, add 2 to 3 tablespoons water and cover immediately. Flip once during the cooking.

Remove the neck and innards from the chicken cavity and either reserve them for making stock or gravy or discard them. Remove the chicken fat from the cavity and set it aside for making the rice.
Place the whole chicken breast-side-up in a 5-quart pot or one that’s deep and wide enough to hold the chicken. Add water until it covers the chicken (about 8 cups of water in my case). Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. Gently move the chicken with a spatula so it does not stick to the bottom. Skim the foam with a fine mesh strainer until the soup becomes clear, 5 minutes or so.
Turn to medium-low heat. Add the ginger, green onion, and salt. Carefully flip the chicken using a spatula and a pair of tongs. Simmer for 10 minutes. Flip the chicken again so the breast side is up. Continue to simmer until the chicken is just cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the size of your chicken. Test the doneness by poking the joint between the thigh and the body with a paring knife. The chicken is cooked if the juice comes out clear. Or you can use a thermometer inserted into the same joint. It should register 165 degrees F (74 C).
Prepare a large ice bath when the chicken is almost done.
When the chicken is done, immediately remove it from the pot and plunge it into the ice bath to cool. This process will tighten the chicken skin and stop the cooking process to keep the meat tender. Once the chicken is mostly cooled, 3 to 4 minutes, drain and pat it dry with paper towels. Transfer to a cutting board to air dry.
Strain and save the chicken broth for cooking the rice and making chicken soup.
Rice
While the chicken is cooling, prepare the rice. Heat the reserved chicken fat in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir occasionally, until the oil renders. You should have about 2 tablespoons of oil in your pan. If there isn’t enough chicken fat, add some butter to the pan (I used 1 tablespoon of butter).
Add the ginger, garlic, and green onion to the skillet. Cook and stir until fragrant, 1 minute or so. Add the rice and continue stirring until the rice turns pale yellow, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn to medium-low heat. Transfer 3 cups of chicken broth from the big pot you used to cook the chicken to the rice skillet. Cook, covered, for 12 minutes. Then remove the pan from the stove. Let rest, covered for another 10 minutes. Fluff the rice with a spatula. Taste the rice. Add a bit more salt, if needed, and mix well.
Sauce
While cooking the rice, prepare the chicken and the sauce(s). Separate the chicken into legs, breasts, and wings.
Prepare chili dipping sauce: add all the ingredients into a mini-food processor or the chopping container included with your immersion blender. Chop everything into a coarse paste.
Serving
There are two ways to prepare the chicken for serving. You can rub either sesame oil or sweet soy sauce onto the skin. Read more about the two options in the blog post above. Once done, slice the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces. Transfer to a big plate and garnish with cilantro, if using.
Before you serve, you may want to reheat the chicken broth. Garnish the hot soup with cilantro and green onion. Serve the soup with the rice and chicken.

Combine the rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small pot. Heat over medium heat until the brine reaches a boil. Whisk to make sure the sugar dissolves thoroughly. Once done, transfer the pickling liquid to a tupperware container or a medium-sized bowl to cool.

Once done, drain the marinating liquid and set aside the pickled veggies for assembling in the sandwiches.
Brown the ham
When you’re ready to serve, brown the ham. Heat a large nonstick pan over medium-high heat until hot. Add the ham. Fry until both sides are lightly caramelized, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer the ham to a plate.
Assemble the sandwiches

Rinse rice a few times and drain. Add water and mix. Let the rice soak for 30 minutes.
Rinse shiitake mushrooms. Place dried shiitake mushrooms in a medium sized bowl and add warm water to cover. Mix a few times so that the mushrooms are coated with water. Set aside and allow to rehydrate for about 20 minutes. (Slice fresh mushroom if you use it instead.)
Combine chicken, light soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, ginger, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Mix well. Blend in cornstarch and mix well by hand until chicken is evenly coated. Marinate at room temperature.
When the shiitake mushrooms turn soft, carefully rinse mushrooms to remove any dirt. Drain and set aside.
Start cooking
Drain rice and add into a medium sized dutch oven (or clay pot). Add 350 milliliters water. Add Heat over medium high heat. Add 1 teaspoon oil and mix well. Bring to a boil while stirring regularly, just like cooking risotto. Turn to medium heat. Continue to cook and stir, until the water is almost absorbed by the rice, about 5 minutes. Cover and simmer over lowest heat for 10 minutes.
While simmering the rice, cook the chicken and mushrooms. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon of oil into a nonstick skillet over medium high heat until warm. Add chicken and let it cook for 1 minute without stirring. Place the chicken so that you cook the skin side first, until golden brown. Flip and cook the other side until golden brown, and the chicken is half cooked through. Turn to lowest heat. Transfer the chicken to a plate.
(Optional) Use a spoon to transfer the extra oil to a small bowl, until just a thin layer of oil remains in the skillet. If you use skinless chicken, skip this step.
Turn back to medium high heat and add shiitake mushrooms. Stir and cook for 2 minutes. Transfer to a plate and set aside.
When the rice is ready (the water should be fully absorbed by now), arrange chicken, mushrooms, and Chinese broccoli on top of the rice. Cover and continue to simmer for 18-20 minutes (the longer you simmer, the more crispy the rice on the bottom will be). Be careful - you should move as quickly as you can, so the temperature of the rice won’t drop too much.
While the rice is cooking, mix the oyster sauce with the sugar and garlic in a small bowl.
When the rice is done, remove from heat and uncover. Drizzle oyster sauce on top immediately, while the rice is hot, and mix everything well with a spatula. I suggest you scrape the rice from the bottom while the pot is still warm. Otherwise, it will be a bit difficult to scoop out.
